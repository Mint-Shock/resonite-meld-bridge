# Meld Bridge
A Node.js bridge for securely controlling [Meld Studio](https://meldstudio.co/) from within Resonite.

## Features
- Allows for a Secure and easy to use bidirectional connection between Resonite and Meld.
- Simplifies what Resonite receives and has to send to minimize slow [string] operations inside of Resonite.
- Adds message authentication using a secret key that has to be sent with every message from Resonite to the Bridge to ensure a more secure Connection.
	- Use at your own risk. More about security [here](#security-considerations).
- Currently supports the following features of Meld's API:

### Security considerations

> Resonite should NEVER be allowed to directly connect to Meld directly (ws://127.0.0.1:13376/) because Meld currently has no authentication and accepts everything that is a valid Message

- Â This would in theory allow anyone in your current Resonite Session to gain (almost) full access to your Meld Studio instance. Including starting a stream without your permission.
- NEVER allow direct host access to: `ws://127.0.0.1:13376/` only ever accept `Meld Bridge address and port here` (or whatever address and port that is configured in config.json)
	- My MeldBridgeClient tries to ensure this during the setup wizard by propting them to refuse direct host access to Meld. Though sadly I can't check if it was actually declined or just ignored. But it's fine as long as it can't connect directly to Meld

## Getting Started
### Install and setup Meld studio
1. https://meldstudio.co/
2. Enable remote connections: 
	1. File>Preferences
	2. Advanced > `[X]` Allow remote connections

### Setup Meld Bridge
**WIP**
- Will likely be a executable file (.exe) that autostarts whenever you open Meld Studio and a config.JSON file where you can change settings like the secret key. 
- **NEVER use the standard Secret**


### Resonite
**WIP**
1. Use my premade Integration: "MeldBridgeClient"
	- You can find the newest version in my public folder under
	- `Mint Shock Public/Systems/Integrations/Meld Bridge`
	- `Comming soon`
2. Make your own by sending messages in the following format: 
*Calling Methods*
```
{
  "secret": "MySuperSecretKey123",
  "method": "toggleRecord"
}
```

*Methods with arguments*
```
{
  "secret": "MySuperSecretKey123",
  "method": "setStagedScene",
  "args": ["E9B25AD7242E540F5D2507237ACDAE37"]
}
```

*Subscribing to signals*
```
{
  WIP
  Currently only works for sessionChanged
}
```

*sendCommand*
```
{
  WIP
}
```

**please ensure that a user does not allow direct connections to Meld.** 
I do this by trying to connect directly. If that fails then everything is good. If it succeeds I prompt the user to Reset host access settings and try again. 
My "MeldBridgeClient" in specific does the following and I suggest you do the same: 
1. Try to connect to the Bridge. Ask for Host access permissions if not already given. 
2. On success try to connect to Meld directly. 
	1. The host access Message the user now sees has a clear Text prompting them to decline the direct connection
	2. If they refused direct connection then everything is fine. If they accepted it I will yell at the user to reset host access settings and try again.

## ToDo
- [ ] don't let the user use the default key
- [ ] make a executable file that autostarts with meld
